# Voodoo Water Tower

### Possible Future Features:
* Different Light Speeds
* Mode button
* Separate buttons for changing lights' PWM?

### How it works:
The pump with pump out beads of water at a specified rate. When The LEDs are flashed, the light reflects off of each bead of water. When the LEDs flash at the exact same rate as the pump, the  next bead of water will be in the same spot as the last previous bead causing it to appear as if the water is floating.

To get some cool effects, the rate that the LEDs are flashing can be changed. When the LEDs flash slower than the pump, the beads look like they are slowly falling. When they are flashed faster then the pump, the beads look like they are rising to the top.
